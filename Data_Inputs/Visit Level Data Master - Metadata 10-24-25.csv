Soil_Temp_C,"Point-in-time soil temperature (Celsius) taken with thermometer just outside collar (typically ~10 cm N of collar).

Piez_Condition,"Markers for piezometer caveats: To_Ground = measurement to top of saturated soil outside piezometer; Empty = no water in piezometer; Silty = bottom of piezometer is full of silt; Slightly_Silty = a little silt in piezometer; Frozen_Top = thin layer of ice at top of piezometer. Silty measurements from 2024 are to start of silt/wet soil, while 2025 measurements are to start of saturated-looking soil or bottom of piezometer if silt was dry... but consider changing all silty measurements to ""empty""/~51.5 cm+ - consolidated silt that looks saturated is likely just wicking water.
